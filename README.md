This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"A Mode-Agnostic Multi-Horizon Upper Bound for Univariate Time Series Prediction"** (AAAI 2026). Our work introduces a principled framework for quantifying the fundamental limits of predictability in multi-horizon time series forecasting using information-theoretic and chaos-theoretic approaches.



## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This work addresses the fundamental challenge of determining the theoretical limits of predictability in multi-horizon time series forecasting. Our framework provides:

1. **Information-theoretic bounds** based on horizon-specific entropy rate estimation
2. **Chaos-theoretic bounds** using Lyapunov exponents to model predictability decay
3. **Noise correction mechanisms** for tighter bound estimation
4. **Model-agnostic benchmarks** applicable to any forecasting approach

The theoretical bounds are validated across diverse real-world datasets and state-of-the-art forecasting models, demonstrating their utility as absolute benchmarks for forecasting performance.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Multi-horizon predictability bounds**: Quantifies fundamental limits across forecast horizons
